## Interesting Issues:
### Deletion and Addition of photos in Album Edit
[Back to top](#table-of-contents) 

<b>Issue</b>: Was having a hard to visualizing the UI of the album edit functionality. Users needed to be able to add and delete photos from an album simultaneously.

<b>Solution</b>: I ended up creating two seperate useStates, one for the addition of photos, and one for the removal of photos. As a user clicks photos through this page, it will detect whether it has been added or not, and remove/add it to the appropriate useState array. Upon completion both arrays will be send to the API to persist these changes to the database. As for the UI, I wanted something sleek and easy to understand. I did this by having photos that are already in, or have been selected, have 100% opacity, more shadow, and growing the size a bit. Conversely, when a photo is not selected, they would have 50% opacity, less shadow, and shrink.


## Features to Implement Next
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

<b>Overview</b>:

### <b>Feature</b>: Drag and Drop for photo uploads
<b>How I would do it</b>: I will do this by utilizing the React-DnD package. This will allow users to drag and drop the photos they wish to upload, and it will allow the user to see the photo before submitting.

### <b>Feature</b>: User Info popup
<b>How I would do it</b>: I will do this by filling my redux feed slice of state with a bit more information on the owner of each photo. When a user hovers over the name of a photo card, I will set the visibility of a relatively positioned div to visible, revealing some of the other photos that user has uploaded, and allowing the user to follow the other user from this container.
